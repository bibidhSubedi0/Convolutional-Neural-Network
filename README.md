# Convolutional Neural Network

This project is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in C++. The goal is to build and train a CNN from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of deep learning models.

## Features

- **Convolutional Layers**: Implemented in `ConvolutionLayers.cpp` and `ConvolutionLayers.hpp`.
- **Deep Network Architecture**: Managed by `DeepNetwork.cpp` and `DeepNetwork.hpp`.
- **Image Input Handling**: Facilitated through `ImageInput.cpp` and `ImageInput.hpp`.
- **Layer Management**: Defined in `Layer.cpp` and `Layer.hpp`.
- **Matrix Operations**: Handled by `Matrix.cpp` and `Matrix.hpp`.
- **Neuron Functionality**: Implemented in `Neuron.cpp` and `Neuron.h`.
- **Main Execution**: The entry point of the program is `main.cpp`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler supporting C++20
- OpenCV library for image reading and displaying purpose.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bibidhSubedi0/Convolutional-Neural-Network.git
   ```
2. **Open you Visual Studio**
3. **Set up your compier and linker and you are good to go**
   

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and includes appropriate documentation.

## Acknowledgments

- Inspiration from various deep learning resources and tutorials.
- OpenCV for basic Image handling, kind of an overkill but okay for now
